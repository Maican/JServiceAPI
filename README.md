Running this should be fairly simple, have Python installed and run main.py.

You are able to retrieve a list of random clues with the leftmost button and text-field. Enter the number of clues you want and a handy listbox will appear that is scrollable.

You are able to retrieve a simple random queston in a Flashcard style approach with the center button, where you can click "Yes" to see the answer once you have thought about it, or "No" to back out without seeing the answer.

You can also search the database of clues with the rightmost button. You can search by value, category ID (Need a list of categories and their IDs somewhere for lookup yet), a minimum date and maximum date.
